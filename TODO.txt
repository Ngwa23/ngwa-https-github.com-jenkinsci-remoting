Prefetch branch TODO before merge
=================================

- constant pool analyzer must be shaded & rebundled
- some classes should be traversed more deeply
  - base class and interfaces (this might be easy enough)
  - types used in static fields

- ClassLoader oracles
  - for creating a smarter remote classloader clone
    built on top of ClassLoader -> IClassLoader translation service
    & jar transfer service

- if jar is still loading, fall back to fetch2
